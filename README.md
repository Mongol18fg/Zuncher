## 📈 Status
Zuncher had already been created, but due to some circumstances it was not released to the public, and its sources and executable file were lost. At the moment, the "Project ZORGV" development team is trying to recreate and improve it. Collect hopium!

**At the moment, it is ready:**

- Minimum implementation
- Interface (halfway)


**When will the first beta be released?**

~~When pigs fly...~~ Our launcher will be released as soon as we implement a sufficient minimum of functions for convenient use of the launcher.
But this may not be soon, because only one person from the team is currently engaged in the project (this is done for internal reasons of the team). However, we ourselves hope that the minimum implementation will be ready very soon! Gain patience friends! We will try to make the beta as soon as possible!

## FAQ

### Why do you need another launcher if you have BetaCraft?
- That's a fair question! BetaCraft is amazing for simply running old versions. Zuncher is more about enhancing them:
Easy mod installation (no manual .jar editing)
Custom skins/capes for versions that never supported them
Performance optimizations for modern Linux systems
A unified interface for both Alpha and Beta with nostalgic flair
We love BetaCraft—it inspired us! But we wanted something more specialized for the tinkerers and nostalgics

### Why should I choose your launcher?
- We do not believe that our launcher is better than others, and we do not encourage you to choose our launcher. It's your choice. But our launcher offers more options for working with the game, which makes your gaming experience more interesting, which may push you to buy Minecraft.

### Why do you make the launcher in C# and not in cross-platform java?
- Because we want to create exclusive Linux software that can draw your attention to Linux and help the OpenSource community expand and strengthen.

### Can I use your launcher code in my projects?
- Of course! You are free to use our source code for your projects (even if they are proprietary). You can change the code. But all this is only allowed if you are not selling software that uses our source code.

### Will the launcher be ported to other platforms?
- No! We will not port the launcher to other platforms. We are devotees of GNU/Linux and OpenSource, we only want to draw your attention to the more open world of OpenSource with GNU/Linux, not to draw your attention to closed MacOS or Windows.

### Do I need a license?
- No. You don't need a license, we believe that software should be available to everyone, not just those who have money. If you have money and are inspired by Minecraft using our launcher, you can support Mojang and buy minecraft.

### Do you engage in piracy?
- Of course not! We take all versions of the game from open sources - Minecraft Fandom. We do not pirate games in any way.

### Can I help the development?
- In principle.. Yes! You can write to our corporate email (pzorgv@freenet.am) with a request for the rights to change the repository, you can be given them.
