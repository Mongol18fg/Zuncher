## 📈 Status
Zuncher had already been created, but due to some circumstances it was not released to the public, and its sources and executable file were lost. At the moment, the "Project ZORGV" development team is trying to recreate and improve it. Collect hopium!

**At the moment, it is ready:**

- Minimum implementation
- Interface (halfway)


**When will the first beta be released?**

~~When pigs fly...~~ Our launcher will be released as soon as we implement a sufficient minimum of functions for convenient use of the launcher.
But this may not be soon, because only one person from the team is currently engaged in the project (this is done for internal reasons of the team). However, we ourselves hope that the minimum implementation will be ready very soon! Gain patience friends! We will try to make the beta as soon as possible!
